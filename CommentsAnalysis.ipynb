            "['In the 20 years of its existence, The Fast & the Furious franchise has upgraded itself several times over the years. What started as a story about illegal street racing transitioned to heist thrillers with Fast Five and with every next sequel inflating the action set pieces & discarding physics, the series now enjoys the same status as comic-book blockbusters, glued together by its sermons about family. F9 continues this new tradition by taking things to preposterous heights and is another dumb entry in the saga.', <br/>, <br/>, \"Directed by Justin Lin (Fast Five & Star Trek Beyond), this ninth instalment simply looks at all the ridiculous premise & over-the-top action the last few instalments employed and just tries to take the next big leap. Logic & gravity left the saga a long time back so viewers expecting any of it now are only kidding themselves. Brainless entertainment can be fun when it's done right but it's all executed so terribly here that along with common sense goes its sense of joy. The action & drama just feels bland, soulless & uninspiring.\", <br/>, <br/>, \"If you thought that Dom & his so-called family taking on planes, trains, tanks & submarine in the previous chapters was a tad too much then you will be amused by the places this sequel ventures to. And yet, none of it feels even remotely surprising. It's full of setups, twists & dull action that never for once stimulate the senses and are predictable from afar. Performances don't deserve a mention just like the schlocky writing on display here. Its 143 mins runtime is strongly felt and even its attempts at humour fall flat this time around.\", <br/>, <br/>, \"Overall, F9 is as forgettable as it is formulaic and isn't even enjoyable for the most part. The ridiculous action sequences dialled to extremity is just hollow from within, and fall way short of delivering the desired payoff. From beginning to end, it is an absolute chore to sit through. Despite the glaring shortcomings, fans of the saga may still manage to scavenge something out of this big-budget garbage. A lifeless & lacklustre piece of blockbuster filmmaking, F9 is one of the weakest additions to The Fast Saga and is no less than an utter disappointment.\"]\n",

Meanwhile the power of family is too strong for the planet and it ruptures but luckily vin diesel is able to jump into his Dodge Charger just in time. The planet had no effect on him cause of the titanium roll cage.\n",

F&amp;F is known for going crazier and crazier with each entry, but I think it's gone too far for its own good. Not one action scene entertained me; none of the scenes were creative, they were just dumb. Some may find enjoyment from how ridiculous it is, but I was just left unimpressed.And the story was exactly the same as the last few F&amp;F movies. They're so similar that you can literally predict what happens if you've recently watched F8 or F7. F&amp;F has gone so far from it's roots that I've given up on the franchise. At least give one spin-off for the car guys and OG fans, maybe something similar to the first three F&amp;Fs, it'll hurt nobody, Universal.This movie is just really bad. Tons of plot holes, ridiculous action scenes, and a story that disgraces what F&amp;F used to be. As a huge and longtime fan of the franchise, I have now lost faith. This film is a disgrace, and I refuse to believe that John Cena is Dominic Toretto's brother.\n",

Soon the storyline will be 2 explosions from opposite side of the tracks who fall in love.It is insulting to the audience. Actors should give their money back for making society even more dumb and primitive. Then ban the writers, director and producers from hollybank.All that money and budget, probabily 125 writers they hired and they couldnt come up with a movie that would be something above the quality of a toilet cleaner. Actually all commercials,even those 5 second ones, are above this nonsense.All in all, generic, insultingly dumb, unfunny and a horrible mess.\n",

This movie is so out there and unrealistic it just makes the whole thing dumb. Some examples, driving a jeep across a falling bridge but still makes it to the other side (forget gravity), flying a car into space and destroying a satellite by ramming it with the car, using magnets to take over a truck. Movie also introduces John Cena as Dom's younger brother whom just happens to work for the guy that wants to take over the world. Of course there is history with Dom blaming Jakob for their dad's death. And they have a big fight on top a big rig, just silly.FINAL VERDICT: Not worth your time.\n",

              "7   In the 20 years of its existence, The Fast &amp; the Furious franchise has upgraded itself several times over the years. What started as a story about illegal street racing transitioned to heist thrillers with Fast Five and with every next sequel inflating the action set pieces &amp; discarding physics, the series now enjoys the same status as comic-book blockbusters, glued together by its sermons about family. F9 continues this new tradition by taking things to preposterous heights and is another dumb entry in the saga.Directed by Justin Lin (Fast Five &amp; Star Trek Beyond), this ninth instalment simply looks at all the ridiculous premise &amp; over-the-top action the last few instalments employed and just tries to take the next big leap. Logic &amp; gravity left the saga a long time back so viewers expecting any of it now are only kidding themselves. Brainless entertainment can be fun when it's done right but it's all executed so terribly here that along with common sense goes its sense of joy. The action &amp; drama just feels bland, soulless &amp; uninspiring.If you thought that Dom &amp; his so-called family taking on planes, trains, tanks &amp; submarine in the previous chapters was a tad too much then you will be amused by the places this sequel ventures to. And yet, none of it feels even remotely surprising. It's full of setups, twists &amp; dull action that never for once stimulate the senses and are predictable from afar. Performances don't deserve a mention just like the schlocky writing on display here. Its 143 mins runtime is strongly felt and even its attempts at humour fall flat this time around.Overall, F9 is as forgettable as it is formulaic and isn't even enjoyable for the most part. The ridiculous action sequences dialled to extremity is just hollow from within, and fall way short of delivering the desired payoff. From beginning to end, it is an absolute chore to sit through. Despite the glaring shortcomings, fans of the saga may still manage to scavenge something out of this big-budget garbage. A lifeless &amp; lacklustre piece of blockbuster filmmaking, F9 is one of the weakest additions to The Fast Saga and is no less than an utter disappointment.\n",
              "8          As Tej (played by Ludacris) says in the movie: \"as long as we obey the laws of physics, then we'll be fine, okay?\"Yeah, that concept is right out the window in this movie. Literally. But hey, at least this 2021 movie titled \"F9\" made for some really good laughs.Granted, I wasn't expecting a whole lot from director Justin Lin's movie here, as the franchise has been one steady downhill ride since after the first movie. And with each movie things become more and more outrageous and out of hand. In fact, by now the movie franchise ought to be renamed into \"The Outrageous and Ludicrous\".Still, I had the opportunity to watch \"F9\", and so I did, as I hadn't already seen it. And yeah, \"F9\" was as laughable as I had anticipated it.Actually, Cipher (played by Charlize Theron) actually summarized how I was feeling throughout the entire movie here, with one single line that she uttered in the movie; \"you got to be kidding me.\"Visually then \"F9\" was good. Yeah, I will say that much, because the visuals definitely are top notch and help carry the movie, as basically everything else in the movie wasn't doing much for the movie.And yeah, they had a very impressive cast ensemble for \"F9\", I will admit that much. What does amaze me, however, is that people on the cast list don't stop up and go \"really?\" when they read the script. But I guess, a dollar is a dollar, huh?If you sit down to watch \"F9\", you have to put aside anything called laws of physics and realism. Because all those concepts are non-existing in this movie. And the abundance of things that was downright laughable and outrageous in \"F9\" is countless, but at least they provided me with a heap of laughs. Yeah, I couldn't help laugh throughout the majority of this movie, because it was just so bad.\"F9\" is a watchable movie, but it is essentially just another testimony to why the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise should have stopped after \"Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift\".I am rating \"F9\" a very bland and mediocre five out of ten stars. This is a movie that left no impressions on me, and it is one that will just quietly fade into oblivion, given its ludicrous over-the-top lack of respect for laws of physics, gravity and realism.\n",

From plot to performances bad. This franchise needs to be killed and Diesel retired.I mean why do they fight like cyborgs and super heroes? Every scene made to feel emotional but stupid with lame dialogues, predictable set pieces and Diesel acting so heroic and appearing just at the last moments to sort of bring hope.....with his stupid monotonous voice.My one star is just for the effects, camera movements and panning, nothing else. Gosh, this feels like a school project and the student needs an F. Guys, just skip this.\n",

It does have enough action and effects to get thru a sitting if you are truly bored, but it's a damnation of Hollywood that a 10th installment of this car wreck of a series will surely be made.\n",

And no dust. Apparently part of the job of the army is to wet down hinky roads. I'm fine with the outlandish stunts like a truck defying gravity on a collapsing bridge. But seriously dump the hot wheels and get one of those Toyota PUs with a scant 250 thousand miles if you want to make back road driving real. Back acting and many plot holes. How did Dom or Roman or whatever his name is now find a baby sitter in time to huff up to the plane to adventure? We need a new franchise.\n",

Toretto's younger self has no resemblance to him now whatsoever. And that's the least of the utterly ridiculous things that the filmmaker's trying to make you buy into for 2 hours. Lame dialogue.

John Cena has joined the series as another master assassin who happens to be the brother that Vin Diesel has never mentioned in his never-ending quest for family. The locations include Tbilisi in Georgia, to Yorkshire, which stands in for Chernyobl. The vroom-vroom of the cars is restrained in the first two-thirds of the movie; they're replaced by muscular men who once hoped to be actors punching each other without doing damage to either their opponents or their hands.There's a big action sequence about the two-hour mark in this movie. While most of the cast is busy wrecking Tbilisi's light-rail system, others are driving a car in space. I could, I suppose, try to explain it, but why? Director Justin Lin thought it would be cool.I can think of no words to express my feelings that would not get me banned.\n",

What started as a story about illegal street racing transitioned to heist thrillers with Fast Five and with every next sequel inflating the action set pieces &amp;amp; discarding physics, the series now enjoys the same status as comic-book blockbusters, glued together by its sermons about family. F9 continues this new tradition by taking things to preposterous heights and is another dumb entry in the saga.Directed by Justin Lin (Fast Five &amp;amp; Star Trek Beyond), this ninth instalment simply looks at all the ridiculous premise &amp;amp; over-the-top action the last few instalments employed and just tries to take the next big leap. Logic &amp;amp; gravity left the saga a long time back so viewers expecting any of it now are only kidding themselves. Brainless entertainment can be fun when it's done right but it's all executed so terribly here that along with common sense goes its sense of joy. The action &amp;amp; drama just feels bland, soulless &amp;amp; uninspiring.If you thought that Dom &amp;amp; his so-called family taking on planes, trains, tanks &amp;amp; submarine in the previous chapters was a tad too much then you will be amused by the places this sequel ventures to. And yet, none of it feels even remotely surprising. It's full of setups, twists &amp;amp; dull action that never for once stimulate the senses and are predictable from afar. Performances don't deserve a mention just like the schlocky writing on display here. Its 143 mins runtime is strongly felt and even its attempts at humour fall flat this time around.Overall, F9 is as forgettable as it is formulaic and isn't even enjoyable for the most part. The ridiculous action sequences dialled to extremity is just hollow from within, and fall way short of delivering the desired payoff. From beginning to end, it is an absolute chore to sit through. Despite the glaring shortcomings, fans of the saga may still manage to scavenge something out of this big-budget garbage. A lifeless &amp;amp; lacklustre piece of blockbuster filmmaking, F9 is one of the weakest additions to The Fast Saga and is no less than an utter disappointment.</td>\n",

              "      <td>As Tej (played by Ludacris) says in the movie: \"as long as we obey the laws of physics, then we'll be fine, okay?\"Yeah, that concept is right out the window in this movie. Literally. But hey, at least this 2021 movie titled \"F9\" made for some really good laughs.Granted, I wasn't expecting a whole lot from director Justin Lin's movie here, as the franchise has been one steady downhill ride since after the first movie. And with each movie things become more and more outrageous and out of hand. In fact, by now the movie franchise ought to be renamed into \"The Outrageous and Ludicrous\".Still, I had the opportunity to watch \"F9\", and so I did, as I hadn't already seen it. And yeah, \"F9\" was as laughable as I had anticipated it.Actually, Cipher (played by Charlize Theron) actually summarized how I was feeling throughout the entire movie here, with one single line that she uttered in the movie; \"you got to be kidding me.\"Visually then \"F9\" was good. Yeah, I will say that much, because the visuals definitely are top notch and help carry the movie, as basically everything else in the movie wasn't doing much for the movie.And yeah, they had a very impressive cast ensemble for \"F9\", I will admit that much. What does amaze me, however, is that people on the cast list don't stop up and go \"really?\" when they read the script. But I guess, a dollar is a dollar, huh?If you sit down to watch \"F9\", you have to put aside anything called laws of physics and realism. Because all those concepts are non-existing in this movie. And the abundance of things that was downright laughable and outrageous in \"F9\" is countless, but at least they provided me with a heap of laughs. Yeah, I couldn't help laugh throughout the majority of this movie, because it was just so bad.\"F9\" is a watchable movie, but it is essentially just another testimony to why the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise should have stopped after \"Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift\".I am rating \"F9\" a very bland and mediocre five out of ten stars. This is a movie that left no impressions on me, and it is one that will just quietly fade into oblivion, given its ludicrous over-the-top lack of respect for laws of physics, gravity and realism.</td>\n",

              "7   In the  years of its existence The Fast amp the Furious franchise has upgraded itself several times over the years What started as a story about illegal street racing transitioned to heist thrillers with Fast Five and with every next sequel inflating the action set pieces amp discarding physics the series now enjoys the same status as comicbook blockbusters glued together by its sermons about family F continues this new tradition by taking things to preposterous heights and is another dumb entry in the sagaDirected by Justin Lin Fast Five amp Star Trek Beyond this ninth instalment simply looks at all the ridiculous premise amp overthetop action the last few instalments employed and just tries to take the next big leap Logic amp gravity left the saga a long time back so viewers expecting any of it now are only kidding themselves Brainless entertainment can be fun when its done right but its all executed so terribly here that along with common sense goes its sense of joy The action amp drama just feels bland soulless amp uninspiringIf you thought that Dom amp his socalled family taking on planes trains tanks amp submarine in the previous chapters was a tad too much then you will be amused by the places this sequel ventures to And yet none of it feels even remotely surprising Its full of setups twists amp dull action that never for once stimulate the senses and are predictable from afar Performances dont deserve a mention just like the schlocky writing on display here Its  mins runtime is strongly felt and even its attempts at humour fall flat this time aroundOverall F is as forgettable as it is formulaic and isnt even enjoyable for the most part The ridiculous action sequences dialled to extremity is just hollow from within and fall way short of delivering the desired payoff From beginning to end it is an absolute chore to sit through Despite the glaring shortcomings fans of the saga may still manage to scavenge something out of this bigbudget garbage A lifeless amp lacklustre piece of blockbuster filmmaking F is one of the weakest additions to The Fast Saga and is no less than an utter disappointment\n",

              "7   in the  years of its existence the fast amp the furious franchise has upgraded itself several times over the years what started as a story about illegal street racing transitioned to heist thrillers with fast five and with every next sequel inflating the action set pieces amp discarding physics the series now enjoys the same status as comicbook blockbusters glued together by its sermons about family f continues this new tradition by taking things to preposterous heights and is another dumb entry in the sagadirected by justin lin fast five amp star trek beyond this ninth instalment simply looks at all the ridiculous premise amp overthetop action the last few instalments employed and just tries to take the next big leap logic amp gravity left the saga a long time back so viewers expecting any of it now are only kidding themselves brainless entertainment can be fun when its done right but its all executed so terribly here that along with common sense goes its sense of joy the action amp drama just feels bland soulless amp uninspiringif you thought that dom amp his socalled family taking on planes trains tanks amp submarine in the previous chapters was a tad too much then you will be amused by the places this sequel ventures to and yet none of it feels even remotely surprising its full of setups twists amp dull action that never for once stimulate the senses and are predictable from afar performances dont deserve a mention just like the schlocky writing on display here its  mins runtime is strongly felt and even its attempts at humour fall flat this time aroundoverall f is as forgettable as it is formulaic and isnt even enjoyable for the most part the ridiculous action sequences dialled to extremity is just hollow from within and fall way short of delivering the desired payoff from beginning to end it is an absolute chore to sit through despite the glaring shortcomings fans of the saga may still manage to scavenge something out of this bigbudget garbage a lifeless amp lacklustre piece of blockbuster filmmaking f is one of the weakest additions to the fast saga and is no less than an utter disappointment   \n",
